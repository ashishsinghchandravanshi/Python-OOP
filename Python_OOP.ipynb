        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming is a programming approach based on objects and classes.\n",
        "It uses four main principles — Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.\n",
        "OOP helps in writing clean, reusable, and modular code by modeling real-world entities as objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class in OOP is a Blueprint or Template that define the  properties and Behaviours of  objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object in OOP is an instance of class.It represent the real world entity and contain data (attributes) and Function (methods) define by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction → Hides unnecessary details and shows only the essential features.\n",
        "- Encapsulation → Wraps data and methods together and protects the data using access control.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods in Python are special built-in methods whose names start and end with double underscores, like __init__ or __str__.\n",
        "They allow objects to support built-in operations such as initialization, printing, adding, comparing, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where one class (child class) can acquire the properties and behavior of another class (parent class).\n",
        "It allows you to reuse code instead of writing it again.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- In OOP, it allows the same function or method name to behave differently depending on the object that is calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It gives flexibility and makes code more reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to variables and methods using access modifiers like:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Public → accessible everywhere\n",
        "\n",
        "  Protected (_) → intended for internal use (convention-based)\n",
        "\n",
        "  Private (__) → name-mangled, cannot be accessed directly from outside the class\n",
        "\n",
        "  You control access using getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor in Python is a special method named __init__ that runs automatically when an object is created.\n",
        "Its main job is to initialize (set up) the object’s data/attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class Method\n",
        "\n",
        "  A class method is a method that works with the class itself, not with an object.\n",
        "  It takes cls as the first parameter (class ka reference).\n",
        "- Static Method\n",
        "\n",
        "  A static method has no connection with the object or the class.\n",
        "  This means:\n",
        "\n",
        "  No self\n",
        "\n",
        "  No cls\n",
        "\n",
        "  It behaves just like a normal function, but it is placed inside a class for better organization or logical grouping.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Python simulates overloading using default arguments or *args/**kwargs, which allow a single method to accept different numbers of parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding means defining a method in the child (subclass) with the same name, same parameters, and same signature as in the parent class — but giving it a new or modified behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator is used to turn a class method into a getter,\n",
        "  so you can access a method like an attribute—without using parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "  It helps you:\n",
        "\n",
        "  hide internal details (encapsulation)\n",
        "\n",
        "  control how values are accessed\n",
        "\n",
        "   make code cleaner and more readable\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important because it allows the same method name to behave differently depending on which object is calling it.\n",
        "This makes code flexible, reusable, and easier to extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "  It helps you:\n",
        "\n",
        "  write general code that works for many object types\n",
        "\n",
        "  avoid duplicate code\n",
        "\n",
        "  add new classes without changing old code\n",
        "\n",
        "  achieve runtime flexibility (dynamic behavior)\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be used only as a base class.\n",
        "It contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared but not implemented.\n",
        "Child classes must provide their own implementation for these methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Modularity\n",
        "  Code is divided into small, manageable classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reusability\n",
        "  Classes and objects can be reused through inheritance, reducing repeated code.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation\n",
        "  Data is protected by keeping it inside the class, improving security and control.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism\n",
        "  Same method name can work differently for different objects, making code flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction\n",
        "  Hides unnecessary details and shows only what’s required.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Easy Maintenance\n",
        "  Debugging and updating become easier because the code is organized and modular.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Scalability\n",
        "  Large applications can be built in a cleaner and more organized way.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class Variable\n",
        "\n",
        "  Shared by all objects of the class\n",
        "\n",
        "  Defined inside the class, but outside methods\n",
        "\n",
        "  Changing it affects every object\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Instance Variable\n",
        "\n",
        "   Unique for each object\n",
        "\n",
        "   Defined inside __init__ using self\n",
        "\n",
        "   Changing it affects only that object\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- ultiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "It helps combine features from multiple classes, but must be used carefully because it can create method resolution conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "- __str__ provides a readable, user-friendly representation of an object (used by print()).\n",
        "- __repr__ provides an unambiguous, developer-oriented representation, ideally useful for debugging or recreating the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- super() is used to call a method from the parent class inside a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  It helps you:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Reuse parent class code without rewriting it\n",
        "\n",
        "  Avoid hard-coding the parent class name\n",
        "\n",
        "  Support multiple inheritance properly\n",
        "\n",
        "  Follow the Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n",
        "\n",
        "  Make your code cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method is a special (destructor) method in Python that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed by the garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Its purpose is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "  release external resources\n",
        "\n",
        "  close files or database connections\n",
        "\n",
        "  perform cleanup before the object is removed from memory  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "  Does NOT take self or cls.\n",
        "\n",
        "  It cannot access instance variables or class variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Behaves like a normal function placed inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Used for utility/helper functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  @classmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "    Takes cls as the first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Can access and modify class variables.\n",
        "  \n",
        "    Used when you want methods that work on the class itself, not objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Often used for alternative constructors.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "-  Polymorphism with inheritance allows a child class to override a parent method, and Python decides at runtime which version to call based on the object.\n",
        "This gives flexible and extensible behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining is the technique of calling multiple methods in one line because each method returns the object (self).\n",

        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method allows an object to be invoked like a function.\n",
